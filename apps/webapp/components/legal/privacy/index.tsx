          (iii) Location Information. Information about the location of your
          device, including GPS location, for purposes of enhancing or
          facilitating the Services. For example, such information may be used
          to enable the functionality or features of the Services that provide
          you with information about stores near you, or enable you to remotely
          order and pay for the Services. We may also use information about the
          location of the device you are using to help us understand how the
          Services and functionality are being used and to deliver more relevant
          advertising.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          The gathering of this information may be used for maintaining the
          quality of the Services we provide, as well as providing overall
          general statistics related to the use of the Services. The
          technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          (i) Cookies. A cookie is a small data file stored on the hard drive of
          your computer either for only the duration of your visit on a website
          ("session cookies") or for a fixed period ("persistent cookies").
          Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. We
          may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive
          experience on the Services.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          (ii) Web Beacons. Web beacons are small files that are embedded in
          webpages, applications, and emails (also known as "clear gifs", "pixel
          tags", "web bugs", and "single-pixel gifs"). Web beacons allow the
          Company, for example, to track who has visited those webpages or
          opened an email, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and for
          other related website statistics.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          (iii) JavaScripts. JavaScripts are code snippets embedded in various
          parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of
          operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain
          functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          (iv) Entity Tags. Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow
          portions of websites to be stored or "cached" within your browser and
          validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating
          website performance since the web server does not need to send a full
          response if the content has not changed.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          (v) HTML5 Local Storage. HTML5 local storage allows data from websites
          to be stored or "cached" within your browser to store and retrieve
          data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          (vi) Resettable Device Identifiers. Resettable device identifiers
          (also known as "advertising identifiers") are similar to cookies and
          are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the
          "Identifier for Advertisers" or "IDFA" on Apple iOS devices and the
          "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming
          media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to
          make online advertising more relevant.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          This Policy does not cover the use of tracking technologies by third
          parties. The Services may contain links, content, advertising, or
          references to other websites by third parties, including advertisers,

          procedures of any third party. We encourage you to read the privacy
          statements and terms and conditions of linked or referenced websites
          you enter. If you have any questions about an ad or other targeted
          content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>C. Demographic Information</div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          We may collect demographic, statistical, or other aggregate
          information that is about you, but individually does not identify you.
          Some of this information may be derived from personal information, but
          it is not personal information and cannot be tied back to you.

        <div className='text-lg font-bold'>6. Use of Services</div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          If you create an account with the Company for any reason, we may use
          your name or your email address as your login name. Alternatively, we
          may use an anonymized login system for your login activity. The
          creation of an account is required because the Services may not be
          able to work without historical data.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          In accessing and using the Services, files and other content might be
          uploaded or created, and other usage-related data can be created,
          collected, and processed.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          The Services work best when information and content is shared. Thus,
          if you upload information or content to the Services, you should
          expect your information or content to be shared with others. We may
          share your information, including any files or content you provide or
          create in the Services, provided that those files or content, by their
          nature, support sharing.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          All the information you upload to the Services are stored on an
          appropriate server infrastructure for processing. Data is typically
          stored on your web browser or mobile device and synced with our
          servers. Data is stored on servers on Google Cloud Platform or similar
          cloud service providers until deleted. Presently, data is stored for
          10 years, but this may change over time. For any files we keep, we
          keep them for the sole purpose of giving you and your designated third
          parties access to the files and data for as long as you need them.
          During that time, we may view that data to, for example, troubleshoot
          problems, or to gather anonymized user data.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          The legal basis of the processing is your consent.

        <div className='mt-4'>
          You may send us an email to request access to, correct, or remove any
          personal information that you have provided to us. You may also
          access, correct, or remove your personal information by logging into
          the Website and visiting your account profile page. We cannot delete

          8. How We Protect Your Information
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          We take reasonable precautions to secure your personal information. We
          have implemented technical, physical, and administrative security
          measures designed to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized
          access, disclosure, or modification of your information. We have put
          in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
          to safeguard the information we collect. All information you provide
          to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. When you
          transmit highly sensitive information (such as a credit card number)
          through the Services, we encrypt the transmission of that information
          using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where
          we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to
          certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this
          password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with
          anyone.
        </div>
        <div className='mt-4'>
          While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist
          safeguarding your personal information, no system or network can be
          guaranteed to be 100% secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
          software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of
          user information at any time. Any transmission of personal information
          is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any
          privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website or any
          other Services.

          In accordance with GDPR, we use the so-called Double Opt-in method. We
          will only send you an email if you confirm by clicking on a link in
          our notification email that you are the owner of the given email
          address. If you confirm your email address, we will save your email
          address and the time of registration until you unsubscribe. You can
          unsubscribe from email at any time, except that we may still send you
          an email if you request a password reset. A corresponding unsubscribe
          link can be found in every email. A message to the above or in the
          specified contact information (e.g. by email) is also sufficient. The
          legal basis of this processing is your consent in accordance with.
          Art. 6 para. 1 lit of the GDPR.

        <div className='mt-4'>
          In our email, we use commercially available technologies that measure
          the interactions with the e-mail (e.g. opening the email, clicked

          evaluations as well as for the optimization and further development of
          our content and customer communication. This is done with the help of
          small graphics that are embedded in the email (so-called pixels). The
          data is collected exclusively pseudonymized and also not linked with
          your other personal information. Legal basis for this is our
          aforementioned legitimate interest. Through our e-mail, we want to
          share content relevant to our customers and better understand what
          readers are actually interested in. If you do not want us to include
          your information in our analysis of usage behavior, you can
          unsubscribe from emails or deactivate graphics in your email program

          Even after that, we sometimes have to save your data for accounting

          automatically creates and displays on your device (laptop, tablet,
          smartphone, etc.) when you access the Services. Cookies do not harm
          your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans, or other malicious
          software. Cookie information is stored, and may result in a connection
          with a specific terminal or browser being used. This does not,
          however, mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. The use
          of cookies serves to increase the usability of the Services. For
          example, we use session cookies to recognize that you have already
          visited individual pages, or that you have completed certain tasks or
          reached certain goals. These are automatically deleted after leaving
          the Services. In addition, to improve usability, we also use temporary
          cookies that are stored on your device for a specified period of time,
          typically 30 days. If you access the Services again, it will
          automatically recognize that you have already been with us and what
          inputs and settings you have made, so you do not have to re-enter
          them. We also use cookies to statistically record the use of the

          Services. These cookies allow us to automatically recognize that you
          have already been with us when you once again access the Services.
          These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined time. Most
          browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your
          browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or always
          provide a hint appearing before a new cookie is created. However,
          disabling cookies completely may mean that you cannot use all features

        <div className='mt-4'>
          Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable

          Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
          Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that
          signals to websites that a User does not want to have his or her
          online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a
          particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block
          that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s
          User. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet
          uniform. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to
          respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them.
          You also can typically remove and reject Cookies or Local Storage from
          the Services with your browser settings. Many browsers are set to

          We may also use other technologies such as Local Storage and Pixel

          Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data.
          A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is
          ordinarily not visible to you and may be associated with Cookies on
