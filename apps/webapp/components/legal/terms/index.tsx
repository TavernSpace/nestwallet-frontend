          party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
          entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a
          claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in
          arbitration you agree to waive any right to a jury trial and any claim
          may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a Delware state
